// Understand Functional Programming Terminology

/* 
Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments
to another function to decide how that function will be 
invoked. 

First class functions (all functions in JavaScript), can
be returned from a function, passed into another function or
assigned to a variable like any other value.

Higher order functions can take a function as an argument
or return a function.

A lambda function can take a function as an argument or
return a function.
