/* Functional programming is about: 
1. Isolated functions that don't depend upon the state or global variables;
2. Pure functions that yeild the same output for the same input;
3. Functions with limited side-effects.

/* The members of freeCodeCamp happen to love tea.

In the code editor, the prepareTea and getTea functions are 
already defined for you. Call the getTea function to get 40 
cups of tea for the team, and store them in the tea4TeamFCC 
variable. */
